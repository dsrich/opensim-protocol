# Textures
## Fetching
TODO: Describe how textures are to be retrieved from the server.

Sources:
- indra/newview/lltexturefetch.{cpp,h} (actually the cpp file in the firestorm viewer is very well documented! figure out who did it to give credit)
- llimage/llimageworker.{cpp,h} (not so much documented, but important because it describes some kind of image decoding)

Notes:
- Mention of j2c images, â†’ JPEG 2000 format?
- Retrieval over both UDP and HTTP
