* Evaluate the feasiblity to organize the messages into submodules/categories.
  We could either dedicate each message to one such category or use manifest files to
  declare which messages belong into a group. This would be especially interesting with
  regards to the codegen.

* OpenMetaverse.StructuredData.LLSD provides an implementation of a LLSD reader, which we will
  most likely need when receiving objects. (But first check if it's still used.)
