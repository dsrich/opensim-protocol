# Surface
This spec describes how surface information (land elevation, water, etc) is encoded.

## Geometry
Each surface entity describes a square shape region.
A surface can have up to 8 optional neighbors in all directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).

M = grids_per_edge = 2^n + 1 where n is a natural number,
L = meters_per_grid

One more row and column are stored in the north and the east to serve as a buffer, to bridge the gap
rendering adjacent surface entities, as indicated in the drawing.

## Layer types
There are multiple kinds of layers, which describe different aspects of surface information and are encoded and compressed differently.
The [Varregion](http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Varregion) extension in OpenSim was originally developed in a fork called Aurora Sim and for the sake of documenting the protocol we stick to this naming.
The following types of layers are known:

| Name         | Code (u8) | Large Region |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------ |
| LAND         | 'L' (76)  | false        |
| WIND         | '7' (55)  | special      |
| CLOUD        | '8' (56)  | no patches?  |
| WATER        | 'W' (87)  | no patches?  |
| AURORA_LAND  | 'M' (77)  | true         |
| AURORA_WIND  | 'X' (88)  | special      |
| AURORA_CLOUD | '9' (57)  | no patches?  |
| AURORA_WATER | ':' (58)  | no patches?  |

TODO: Currently only LAND and AURORA_LAND data is going to be described in further detail, however the other layers are also important and should be covered somewhere.

## Parameters
The following parameters are going to be used in the description of the encoding of surface data:

TODO: Improve this table and remove everything not needed later.

In the Rust code the following parameters are used:

| Name (in spec)        | LL viewer             | description |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| patches_per_edge      | mPatchesPerEdge       | Number of patches on one side of a region. 16 or 32 depending on region size. |
| patches_per_region    | mNumberOfPatches      | patches_per_edge * patches_per_edge |


Other variables are used in the code, however ideally they can be expressed in terms of patches_per_edge, like it was already done for patches_per_region.

TODO: Figure out what mGridsPerEdge is
â†’ value provided by LLSurface::create(S32 grids_per_edge, ...) however it's unclear who even calls this function.

| cell_count_per_edge  | mGridsPerEdge         | M in the above drawing. |
| cell_width           | mMetersPerGrid        | Length of one grid cell. `meters_per_grid = width / (grids_per_edge - 1)`  |
| surface_width        | width, mMetersPerEdge | Length of the surface into one direction in meters. |

TODO: 

From the UDP message `TeleportFinish` we obtain for OpenSim:
region_size_x : RegionSizeX as obtainable from OpenSim (Info message)
region_size_y : RegionSizeY as obtainable from OpenSim

| grids_per_patch_edge | mGridsPerPatchEdge  | WOLRD_PATCH_SIZE = 32 |
mPatchesPerEdge = (mGridsPerEdge - 1) / mGridsPerPatchEdge;
| min_z                | mMinZ               | Minimum z for this region (during the session) |
| max_z                | mMaxZ               | Maximum z for this region (during the session) |

## Encoding
Different layers are encoded differently.

For the LAND and AURORA_LAND layers a variant of DCT (discrete cosine transform) is used.
