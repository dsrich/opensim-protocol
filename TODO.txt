* Evaluate the feasiblity to organize the messages into submodules/categories.
  We could either dedicate each message to one such category or use manifest files to
  declare which messages belong into a group. This would be especially interesting with
  regards to the codegen.

* OpenMetaverse.StructuredData.LLSD : Clean implementation of a LLSD reader/writer.
  At least the reader will be needed since mesh data is encoded with LLSD.

* LLVFS: LindenLab Virtual File System also looks like a (attention sarcsam) fun thing to implement. If we are lucky this is something we won't have to bother with though, let's hope for the best.
