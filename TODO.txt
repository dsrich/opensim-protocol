Before spending too much time on certain aspects of the documentation add the following:

XML format:
* Storing documentation items somewhere where they can be referenced by ID.
  For example there should only be one entry for `AgentId` which should be includable
  from the XML files so it only has to be written once and can be updated more easily.
* Evaluate the different options to link to other documentation entries.
  It would be especially awesome if this could be combined in a meaningful way with rustdoc.

Other things:
* Evaluate the feasiblity to organize the messages into submodules/categories.
  We could either dedicate each message to one such category or use manifest files to
  declare which messages belong into a group. This would be especially interesting with
  regards to the codegen.
